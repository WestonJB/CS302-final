Report:
This challenge was the most confusing and unorganized assignment that
I've ever had. The information presented in the challenge writeup was
very vague and ambiguous in most parts. I assume that the writeup was
intentionally made this way, but nevertheless, it was very difficult to
interpret and very stressful. I personally feel like 5 hours on this
assignment is too much time; all of the previous challenges took me
under 2 hours except for this one, and the amount of time I had in total
to achieve this was very small.
