Report:
This was one of the worst challenges. Not only am I trying to study for the CS302 exam tommorrow, but I have another exam 
this Thursday. Asking us for 5 hours of time working on this challenge cost me greatly on other assignments. In addition,
the write-up for this challenge was really confusing and vague in it's description of what it wanted us to do. After debating
with team members on what this challenge required of us, we eventually came to this conculsion as you see now with what I and
my team members have written. But we don't exactly know if this is what was asked for because of the nature of the horrible
challenge 5 write up we were given. Personally, I would've much preferred just 1-2 hours of work required for each member of
the team as no other challenege has taken me this long or been this aggrivating. This challenge also would've instantly been
better had it been any other week, but alas, this week was chosen. In any case, I enjoyed the work I did for this challenge,
but it produced a lot of stress and even now, is cutting into my study time for our class's first exam.

As for work done for challenge 5, I learned a lot about modeling cahracters, objects, and places in blender through Blender
Guru's helpful donut tutorials, studied how to integreate models with UE5, and explored ways of making the process of
producing blender models as well as UE5 integrations faster with shortcuts, better coding techniques, and various other
knowledgee.

Cade Damron's Rubric:
+15 for complete creation of all in-game models for all teams.
	+10 For models of each unit for every team (Blocky, loy-poly models of each faction with at least one defining feature)
	+5 For successful integration of models into Unreal Engine
+15 for complete animations of all in-game models
	+10 Animations work properly in and out of Unreal (No glitchy textures of half-baked models in Unreal)
	+5 Animations have some style and produce an attack fitting for the game of risk.
+10 for helping to code combat animations, combat phases, team interactions with combat, units on each tile, etc...
	+5 for successful dice rolling, attacking phases, health calculations, etc...
	+5 for successful unit amount calculations after combat, movement of units on map, map and model interaction, etc...
+5 for any extra coding bug fixes, proper commenting, proper formatting, etc...
